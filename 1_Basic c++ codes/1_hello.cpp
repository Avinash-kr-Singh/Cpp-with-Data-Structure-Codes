#include<iostream>//include iostream file fot input and output

using namespace std;// include std of namespace -->> we have many namespaces so we need to use  std of particular namespace

int main(){//execution starts from int main()

    //cout<<""<<; is inbulit function inside iostream that prints on console
    cout<<"C++ is super easy...";//flow will not go to next line, ie next line will be printed on same line.
    //cout<<" "<<endl;

    cout<<"go slow..."<<endl;//endl is used for going to new line
    cout<<" "<<endl;

    cout<<"practice...."<<'\n';//\n is new line character and can be used after extraction(>>) operator
    cout<<" "<<endl;

    cout<<"start with easy codes....\n";// can with used inside string
    cout<<" "<<endl;

    printf("Start learning..");//c codes will also work because c++ is superset of c so we can do anthing/everything of C (syntax and semantics) in C++.
    cout<<" "<<endl;

    return 0;//by defualt funvtion has return type as integer so 0 indicates that our code finished without any error.
